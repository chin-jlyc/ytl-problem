The company's policy already references several regulatory bodies and guidelines but does not mention Appendix 10. The new update implies a more comprehensive approach to risk management and emphasizes resilience and vigilance, which may require the company to review its current policies to include or align with the newly introduced Appendix 10 guidelines. This would ensure that the company is adhering to the most current practices for managing technology risks, IT failures, and cyber threats. Additionally, the update suggests that larger institutions should adopt more rigorous practices, which could imply a need for more detailed procedures in the company policy to address these expectations.\nSuggestion Derived From Impact No. 2: Revise the company's internal policy to explicitly reference Appendix 10 as part of the control measures for managing technology risks. This will involve a comprehensive review of the existing risk management framework to align with the new guidelines or requirements introduced in Appendix 10. Additionally, enhance the policy by incorporating more detailed procedures and rigorous practices, especially for larger institutions, to meet the heightened expectations in managing technology risks, IT failures, and cyber threats.

The removal of detailed SLA obligations and specific risk assessment criteria for cloud services deviates from current comprehensive practices dictated by both BNM policies and internal procedures like Information Security Management. The simplification of access control measures, omission of user activity logging, and reduced specificity in risk assessments could necessitate a review of existing policies, especially those related to Information Risk Management and Cyber Resilience as outlined in the company's policy. Moreover, the emphasis on MFA and the introduction of new responsibilities such as continuous monitoring align with current security practices but require further integration into existing policies to ensure compliance with evolving cyber threats. Given these shifts, the company's policy, which is heavily reliant on the BNM and PayNet guidelines for cyber resilience and risk management, should incorporate these updates to maintain alignment with regulatory expectations and ensure comprehensive risk management.\nSuggestion Derived From Impact No. 8: The company policy should be updated to include detailed SLA obligations and specific risk assessment criteria for cloud services, aligning them with both BNM policies and comprehensive internal procedures such as Information Security Management. Additionally, integrate more explicit access control measures, user activity logging, and detailed risk assessment protocols into the existing Information Risk Management and Cyber Resilience policies.

Firstly, the broadened scope of the Comprehensive Cyber Resilience Framework (CRF) to include cybersecurity threat identification, layered security controls, and information sharing enhances alignment with the Information Security Management Procedure and BNM's guidelines on Cyber Resilience. However, the removal of 'Red Team' simulations could affect the depth of vulnerability assessments, which may necessitate a review of the current procedures in place to ensure third-party vulnerabilities are adequately identified.; ; The expanded monitoring requirements to track anomalous activities across critical systems align with the Information Risk Management Policy, but the omission of detailed control measures like penetration testing accompaniment could weaken compliance with BNM's Disaster Recovery Readiness Notification. The introduction of advanced behavioral analysis is a positive enhancement, supporting the SOC's capabilities, but the removal of the holistic infrastructure view requirement may require revisiting the Information Operations Management Procedure to compensate for potential monitoring gaps.; ; The new 'Post-incident activity' section, which mandates post-incident reviews and long-term risk mitigation, complements the BNM Policy Document on Business Continuity Management, suggesting that the company's incident response plan should be updated to reflect these changes. Lastly, the change in the reporting system from ORION 20 to ORION 19 requires an update in the company's reporting procedures to ensure alignment with the new platform.\nSuggestion Derived From Impact No. 14: 1. Incorporate the broadened scope of the Comprehensive Cyber Resilience Framework (CRF) into the company's internal policies to include cybersecurity threat identification, layered security controls, and information sharing. This can be done by updating the Information Security Management Procedure to align with these changes. ; ; 2.

To align with the updated policy, the company policy may need to expand its references to include international compliance standards related to AML, CFT, CPF, and e-KYC solutions. Additionally, the company policy should consider incorporating mechanisms for independent assurance and expanded risk management monitoring as highlighted in the updated policy. This would ensure the company policy aligns with the enhanced compliance and risk management frameworks of the updated policy, reflecting broader regulatory expectations and best practices.\nSuggestion Derived From Impact No. 24: The company policy should be updated to include references to international compliance standards such as Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Counter-Proliferation Financing (CPF). This can be achieved by integrating guidelines and best practices from international bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the United Nations Security Council Resolutions. Additionally, the policy should incorporate e-KYC solutions to enhance customer verification processes, ensuring compliance with modern digital standards. Furthermore, it is essential to establish mechanisms for independent assurance, such as third-party audits, and broaden risk management monitoring to align with the updated policy's emphasis on comprehensive compliance and risk management frameworks.\n",

The company policy, focused on reviewing policies in conjunction with regulatory documents like those from Bank Negara Malaysia, does not directly address e-KYC or digital onboarding processes. Therefore, the update requires the company policy to incorporate or reference the enhanced e-KYC guidelines and digital transformation strategies, particularly in the context of risk management and technology service management.

The update advocates a shift from automated customer IDV to a broader customer onboarding process, requiring refined internal safeguard measures and continuous monitoring. This update is likely to impact the company policy, as the current company policy primarily references general risk management and technology policies without specific provisions for e-KYC or the detailed enhancements required by the updated policy.
