        "impact": "The updated regulatory policy introduces significant changes that affect the Data Management Procedure (DMP) as follows:\n\n1.1 Applicability to Legal Persons: The inclusion of legal persons in the e-KYC policy broadens the scope of data governance and management processes. This necessitates a review of the current DMP to ensure it encompasses legal persons, thereby increasing the regulatory burden on the institution to ensure compliance for a wider range of customers.\n\n1.2 Expanded Applicability: The phrase 'any other institution that may be specified by the Bank' expands the applicability of the DMP. This means that the institution must now consider additional entities that may fall under the DMP, potentially leading to increased compliance requirements and oversight.\n\n1.3 Review Frequency: The current biennial review process may need to be adjusted to accommodate more frequent reviews in light of the expanded scope and potential changes in regulations, business models, or technologies. This could require additional resources to ensure timely updates to the DMP.",
        "recommended_actions": "To align with the new regulatory requirements, the institution should:\n1. Update the DMP to explicitly include legal persons and outline specific data governance processes applicable to them.\n2. Revise the applicability section to reflect the broader scope of institutions that may be subject to the DMP, ensuring clarity on which entities are included.\n3. Consider increasing the frequency of DMP reviews from biennial to annual or as needed, based on regulatory changes or significant shifts in business operations. This will help maintain compliance and adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes.\n4. Provide training for staff on the new requirements and the implications for data management practices, ensuring that all units understand their responsibilities under the updated DMP.",

Here are the key impacts:\n\n1. **Inclusion of Circulars and Supplementary Documents**: The updated policy broadens the scope of documents to be reviewed, now including circulars and supplementary documents. This change increases compliance obligations for financial institutions, necessitating a more comprehensive review process.\n\n2. **Updated Titles and Dates**: The revised titles and dates of the regulatory documents reflect current requirements, which may require the internal policy to be updated to ensure alignment with the latest regulations.\n\n3. **Clarification of Compliance Hierarchy**: The introduction of section 6.2 clarifies the hierarchy of compliance requirements, which may lead to stricter adherence to the most stringent policies. This could impact how the institution manages its compliance framework, necessitating a review of existing procedures to ensure they align with the updated hierarchy.\n\n4. **Broadened Applicability**: The inclusion of 'any other institution that may be specified by the Bank' expands the scope of the policy, potentially increasing regulatory oversight and compliance requirements for additional institutions. This may require the internal policy to explicitly mention these potential additional institutions and outline how compliance will be managed for them.",
        "recommended_actions": "To ensure compliance with the updated regulatory policy, the internal policy section should be revised to include the following actions:\n\n1. **Expand Document Review Process**: Update the internal policy to explicitly include circulars and supplementary documents in the review process. This may involve creating a checklist or framework for regularly monitoring and incorporating these documents into compliance assessments.\n\n2. **Update References**: Revise the section to reflect the most current titles and dates of the relevant regulatory documents. This will ensure that the internal policy remains aligned with the latest regulatory requirements.\n\n3. **Establish Compliance Hierarchy**: Clearly outline the hierarchy of compliance requirements within the internal policy. This may involve creating a flowchart or guidelines that detail how to prioritize compliance with various regulations based on their stringency.\n\n4. **Address Broadened Applicability**: Include a statement in the internal policy that acknowledges the potential for additional institutions to be specified by the Bank. Outline a process for assessing compliance obligations for these institutions as they arise, ensuring that the organization is prepared for any changes in regulatory oversight.",
