This necessitates a review of the current Access Management Procedure (AMP) to ensure alignment with the new standards. The complexity of compliance may increase, requiring additional resources for understanding and implementing the new guidelines. Furthermore, the omission of the issuance date in the legal provision could create ambiguity regarding the applicability of the AMP, potentially affecting compliance efforts.",
        "recommended_actions": "The AMP should be updated to explicitly reference the new guidelines introduced in Appendix 10, ensuring that all units of the institution are aware of the additional practices and standards they must adhere to. It is recommended to include a section that outlines the specific changes and how they integrate with existing procedures. Additionally, the AMP should incorporate a clear issuance date to eliminate any ambiguity regarding its applicability. Training sessions may be necessary to familiarize staff with the new requirements and ensure that operational strategies are adjusted accordingly to meet the updated compliance standards.",

Governance Structure: The lack of proper formatting in the previous version may lead to confusion regarding the responsibilities outlined for the Board of Directors. The updated policy emphasizes the need for clear communication and understanding of governance responsibilities, which may require a revision of the internal policy to ensure clarity.\n\n3. Superseded Documents: The removal of older documents in the updated policy reflects a shift towards a more streamlined regulatory environment. However, this may leave gaps in guidance for institutions that relied on previous documents. The internal policy must be updated to reflect the current list of applicable documents and ensure compliance with the new requirements.",
