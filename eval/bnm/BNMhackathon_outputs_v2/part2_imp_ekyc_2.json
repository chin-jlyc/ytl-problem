        "impact": "The updated regulatory policy introduces significant changes that affect the Incident Management Procedure (IMP) as follows:\n\n1.1 Applicability to Legal Persons: The inclusion of legal persons in the e-KYC policy broadens the scope of incident management to encompass a wider range of customers. This necessitates a review of incident handling procedures to ensure they are applicable to legal entities, which may require additional training and resources.\n\n1.2 Regulatory Compliance: The statement that the IMP is not intended to override regulatory requirements may need to be revised to explicitly acknowledge the new regulatory obligations introduced by the updated policy. This could involve integrating specific compliance measures related to the expanded applicability of the e-KYC policy.\n\n1.3 Review Frequency: The annual review of the IMP may need to be adjusted to ensure it aligns with the frequency of regulatory updates, especially given the potential for more frequent changes in regulations affecting incident management.",
        "recommended_actions": "The internal policy should be updated to explicitly include provisions for handling incidents related to legal persons, ensuring that all units are trained on the new requirements. Additionally, the IMP should incorporate a clause that mandates a review of the policy in conjunction with any updates to the e-KYC policy or other relevant regulations. This will ensure that the institution remains compliant and can effectively manage incidents involving a broader range of customers. Furthermore, it may be beneficial to establish a dedicated team or task force to oversee the implementation of these changes and provide ongoing training to staff on the new compliance requirements.",

This change increases compliance obligations for financial institutions. Additionally, the updated titles and dates reflect current regulatory requirements, necessitating adjustments in operational practices. The introduction of section 6.2 clarifies the hierarchy of compliance requirements, which may lead to stricter adherence to the most stringent policies, impacting how institutions manage their compliance frameworks. Furthermore, the supersession of the previous e-KYC policy indicates a significant update in the regulatory framework, requiring institutions to adapt their practices accordingly.",

It is recommended to revise the list of related policies to ensure it reflects the most current titles and dates. Additionally, the organization should implement a process for regularly reviewing and updating the related policies to align with evolving regulatory requirements. Training sessions may be necessary to ensure that staff are aware of the new compliance obligations and understand the hierarchy of policies.

This may require additional documentation and communication protocols.\n\n2. **Service Desk**: The Service Desk will need to adapt to the new compliance requirements by ensuring that incident logging includes specific information related to technology providers and their compliance status. This may necessitate additional training for staff.\n\n3. **Incident Response Team**: The Incident Response Team must be prepared to manage incidents that arise from compliance failures related to technology providers. This may involve developing new procedures for rapid response to compliance-related incidents.\n\n4. **Change Manager**: The Change Manager will need to incorporate the new regulatory requirements into the change management process, ensuring that all changes related to incident resolutions comply with the updated e-KYC and technology provider standards. This may require a review of existing change approval processes to ensure they meet the new compliance criteria.",
