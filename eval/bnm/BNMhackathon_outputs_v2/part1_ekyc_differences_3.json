By encouraging the use of various verification methods tailored to the business model of the legal person, the policy aims to strengthen the integrity of financial transactions and reduce the risk of money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing (ML/TF/PF). The emphasis on video calls, location verification, and cross-referencing with credible databases is intended to provide a multi-faceted approach to confirming the legitimacy of businesses. This could lead to increased trust in the financial system, but may also impose additional compliance burdens on financial institutions, particularly smaller ones. Furthermore, the potential for unannounced video calls could raise privacy concerns among business owners. Overall, the section seeks to balance the need for robust verification with the operational realities faced by financial institutions, potentially influencing future regulatory practices and compliance standards.",
