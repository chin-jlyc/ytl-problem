This necessitates a review and potential revision of the Incident Management Procedure (IMP) to incorporate these new practices and standards. The current policy does not explicitly reference the new appendix, which may lead to compliance gaps. Additionally, the omission of the issuance date in the legal provision could create ambiguity regarding the applicability of the IMP, affecting compliance and enforcement.",
        "recommended_actions": "The IMP should be updated to explicitly reference Appendix 10 and outline how the new guidelines will be integrated into the existing incident management framework. This may involve revising sections on incident handling and reporting to align with the expanded standards. Furthermore, the IMP should include a clear issuance date to eliminate ambiguity and ensure stakeholders are referencing the correct version. Training sessions may also be necessary to ensure all units understand the new requirements and how to implement them effectively.",

Issuance Dates (New Requirement): The inclusion of issuance dates for each policy document enhances clarity and provides a timeline for relevance. This necessitates an update to the internal policy to include issuance dates for all referenced documents to ensure compliance and clarity.\n\n2. Superseded Documents: The removal of older documents in the updated regulatory policy indicates a shift towards a more streamlined regulatory environment. The internal policy must be revised to reflect the current list of applicable documents, ensuring that outdated references are removed and that the organization is aligned with the latest regulatory requirements.\n\n3. Governance Formatting: The lack of proper formatting in the updated policy could lead to confusion regarding governance responsibilities. The internal policy should be reviewed for clarity and structure to ensure that it effectively communicates the responsibilities of the Board of Directors and other stakeholders, thereby enhancing compliance and governance.",
        "recommended_actions": "The internal policy section should be updated to include the following:\n- Add issuance dates for each referenced policy document to provide clarity and context.\n- Remove any references to superseded documents and ensure that only current policies are listed.\n- Improve the formatting of the internal policy to enhance clarity and understanding of governance responsibilities. This may involve restructuring the document to clearly delineate roles and responsibilities, ensuring that all stakeholders can easily comprehend their obligations under the updated regulatory framework.\nAdditionally, training sessions may be necessary to inform relevant staff about the changes and ensure that they understand the implications for compliance and operational procedures.",

Specifically, the emphasis on cybersecurity awareness and risk assessment may necessitate adjustments in the responsibilities of the Incident Manager and the Incident Response Team. Here are the key impacts:\n\n1. **Incident Manager**: The role may need to include responsibilities for ensuring that incident management processes incorporate cybersecurity considerations, especially in light of the removal of the annual training requirement. This could involve regular updates on cybersecurity threats and ensuring that the team is prepared to respond to incidents related to these threats.\n\n2. **Incident Response Team**: The team may need to expand its scope to include cloud service incidents, as the regulatory changes highlight the need for addressing cloud-specific risks. This will require additional training and possibly the inclusion of cloud service experts within the team to effectively manage these incidents.\n\n3. **Change Manager**: The Change Manager's responsibilities may also need to adapt to ensure that changes related to cybersecurity incidents are communicated effectively and that the impact of these changes on cloud services is assessed thoroughly.",
        "recommended_actions": "To ensure compliance with the updated regulatory requirements, the internal policy should be revised to include the following actions:\n\n- **Update the Incident Manager's Role**: Include specific responsibilities related to cybersecurity incident management, such as ensuring that the team is trained on the latest threats and response strategies.\n- **Expand the Incident Response Team's Scope**: Incorporate cloud service incident management into the team's responsibilities, ensuring that team members receive training on cloud-specific risks and response protocols.\n- **Revise Change Management Procedures**: Ensure that the Change Manager assesses the impact of changes on both cybersecurity and cloud services, and that communication protocols are updated to reflect these changes.\n\nAdditionally, regular training sessions should be implemented to keep all team members informed about evolving cybersecurity threats and best practices, thereby enhancing the institution's overall security posture.",

This means that incidents must not only be categorized based on their immediate impact and urgency but also assessed in the context of overall cyber risk exposure.\n\n2. **Cloud Service Considerations**: With the inclusion of 'cloud service' in the regulatory updates, the internal policy must address incidents related to cloud-specific risks. This may involve revising the categorization matrix to include incidents that specifically pertain to cloud services, such as data breaches or service outages in cloud environments.\n\n3. **Continuous Compliance and Annual Assessment**: The requirement for continuous compliance and annual assessments implies that the incident categorization process must be regularly reviewed and updated.
