        "impact": "The updated regulatory policy introduces significant changes that affect the Access Management Procedure (AMP) as follows:\n\n1.1 Applicability to Legal Persons: The inclusion of legal persons in the e-KYC policy expands the scope of access management requirements. This necessitates a review of the current AMP to ensure it accommodates the new definitions and requirements for legal entities, which may require additional documentation and verification processes.\n\n1.2 Broadened Applicability: The phrase 'any other institution that may be specified by the Bank' broadens the applicability of the AMP. This means that the institution must be prepared to adapt its access management processes to comply with potential new regulatory requirements that could apply to additional institutions.\n\n1.3 Review Frequency: The AMP's review process may need to be adjusted to ensure it aligns with the more dynamic regulatory environment introduced by the updated policy. The annual review may need to be supplemented with more frequent assessments in response to regulatory changes, particularly when significant updates occur in the regulatory framework.",
        "recommended_actions": "To ensure compliance with the updated regulatory requirements, the following actions are recommended:\n1. Revise the AMP to explicitly include provisions for legal persons, detailing the necessary access management processes and documentation required for these entities.\n2. Update the AMP to reflect the broader applicability of the policy, ensuring that it includes a mechanism for identifying and adapting to new institutions specified by the Bank.\n3. Implement a more flexible review process for the AMP, potentially moving to a semi-annual review or establishing a trigger mechanism for reviews based on regulatory updates.\n4. Provide training for staff on the new requirements related to legal persons and the expanded applicability to ensure that all units understand their responsibilities under the updated AMP.",
