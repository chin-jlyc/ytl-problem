This change necessitates a review and potential update of the Change Management Procedure (CMP) to incorporate these new practices and standards. Specifically, the CMP must ensure that it aligns with the expanded guidelines to maintain regulatory compliance. Additionally, the omission of the issuance date in the legal provision could create ambiguity regarding the applicability of the CMP, necessitating a clear reference to the version of the policy being followed.",
        "recommended_actions": "The CMP should be revised to explicitly reference the new guidelines introduced in Appendix 10, ensuring that all changes affecting technology service delivery are compliant with these expanded standards. This may involve updating the objectives of the CMP to include adherence to the new practices outlined in Appendix 10. Furthermore, the CMP should include a clear statement regarding the issuance date and version control to eliminate any ambiguity about the policy's applicability. Training sessions may also be necessary to ensure that all stakeholders understand the implications of the new guidelines and how to implement them effectively.",

Issuance Dates (New Requirement): The updated policy mandates the inclusion of issuance dates for all referenced documents. This change enhances clarity and provides a timeline for the relevance and applicability of each document, which is crucial for compliance and enforcement.\n\n2. Superseded Documents: The removal of older documents in the updated policy indicates a shift towards a more streamlined regulatory environment. However, this may create gaps in guidance for institutions that previously relied on those documents. Financial institutions must ensure they are fully aware of the new requirements and adapt their policies accordingly.\n\n3. Governance Structure: The lack of proper formatting in the updated policy could lead to confusion regarding the governance structure and responsibilities outlined for the Board of Directors. This may impact compliance and governance, necessitating a review of how these responsibilities are communicated within the internal policy.",

This may involve additional collaboration with the Software Engineering team to ensure that cloud services are adequately evaluated for risks.\n\n3. **Governance Structure**: The potential confusion arising from the lack of proper formatting in the regulatory document may require the Change Advisory Committee (CAC) to clarify their roles and responsibilities to ensure effective communication and compliance with governance standards.",
