Here are the specific impacts:\n\n1. Applicability Expansion: The inclusion of 'any other institution that may be specified by the Bank' broadens the scope of the CMP, necessitating a review of which entities fall under this policy. This may require additional compliance measures for a wider range of customers, impacting the planning and execution of changes.\n\n2. Regulatory Burden: The expansion to include legal persons may increase the regulatory burden on the organization, requiring enhanced training and resources to ensure compliance with the new e-KYC requirements. This could necessitate updates to the CMP to incorporate these additional compliance requirements into the change management processes.\n\n3. Focus on Onboarding Processes: The emphasis on improving customer experience and efficiency in onboarding may require the CMP to adapt its objectives to align with these regulatory expectations, potentially leading to a revision of the objectives outlined in section 1.2.",
        "recommended_actions": "The internal policy should be updated to reflect the broader applicability of the CMP, ensuring that it includes provisions for compliance with the new e-KYC requirements. This may involve:\n- Revising section 1.1 to explicitly state the inclusion of legal persons and any other institutions specified by the Bank.\n- Updating section 1.2 to incorporate objectives that focus on enhancing customer experience and efficiency in onboarding processes.\n- Implementing additional training programs for staff to understand the new compliance requirements and how they affect change management.\n- Establishing a process for ongoing review and adaptation of the CMP in response to future regulatory changes, ensuring that it remains aligned with the evolving regulatory landscape.",

Here\u2019s a summary of the impacts:\n\n1. **Broadened Scope of Compliance Documents**: The inclusion of 'circulars' and 'supplementary documents' in the regulatory updates means that financial institutions must now consider a wider array of documents when reviewing compliance. This could lead to increased compliance obligations and necessitate a more comprehensive review process.\n\n2. **Updated Regulatory References**: The updated titles and dates of the regulatory documents reflect current requirements, which may require the internal policy to be revised to include the latest versions of these documents to ensure alignment with regulatory expectations.\n\n3. **Hierarchy of Compliance Requirements**: The introduction of section 6.2 clarifies the hierarchy of compliance requirements, which may necessitate adjustments in how the institution prioritizes compliance efforts. This could impact the internal compliance framework and require a reassessment of existing policies to ensure adherence to the most stringent requirements.\n\n4. **Supersession of Previous Policies**: The indication that the current policy document supersedes the previous e-KYC policy suggests a need for a thorough review of how these changes affect existing practices, particularly in electronic customer verification processes. Financial institutions will need to adapt their internal policies accordingly.\n\n5. **Increased Accountability**: The enhanced accountability measures for the Board regarding the e-KYC solution may require updates to internal governance policies to ensure that the Board is adequately informed and equipped to manage compliance effectively.",
